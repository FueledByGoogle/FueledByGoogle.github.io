# Personal Website

A side project to do in my spare time that isn't too time consuming and does not require a lot of brain power, and I can be creative which is always a plus!

I initially set out with the goal of doing a one page scrolling website; however, I got bored of the one page scrolling layout, especially since a lot of the website out there utilize the same concept. I decided to instead construct a one page website that doesn't require reloading the entire page when navigating between sections.
